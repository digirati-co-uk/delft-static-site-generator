These obstacles are becoming better understood with time, research, and attention to the gender disparities within science, technology, engineering, and math, commonly referred to as the “STEM Gender Gap.” Like too many institutions, TU Delft reflects this STEM Gender Gap in its scientific staff (Fig 1). A companion exhibition, Academic Heritage's <a href=\"https://heritage.tudelft.nl/nl/exhibitions/novieten\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Novices (Novieten)</em></a> shows student gender demographics and details the history of freshwomen at TU Delft.</p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/24/04512068-f975-4487-a8dd-aa868ca48e63/full/full/0/default.jpg\"></p><p><em>Fig 1.

Updated policy could help to tackle inequity and improve representation of women in science.</p><p>One of the key aspects of challenges faced by women is economic. The pay gap between male and female PhD holders in the U.S.A. can be as much as 25%.<sup>1</sup> Science faculty members are more likely to offer jobs to males than females, and pay them more,<sup>2</sup> and it has been shown that institutions support female faculty in resource intensive disciplines less, therefore lowering their publication rates.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Research suggests that factors which may contribute towards this are that women are less persistent in their pursuit of higher salaries than males and that men perceive other men more favourably thus women get overlooked for promotion.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Women are also more likely to be perceived as being less competent than men meaning they are less likely to be offered jobs.<sup>5</sup> Within undergraduate peer groups, female students are less likely to be highly rated than males, due to males overestimating other males,<sup>6</sup> and in some faculties' mentoring requests from females are twice as likely to have a query left unanswered compared to a white male counterpart.<sup>7</sup> There is evidence male students also perceive themselves as being smarter than their female peers, primarily in their ability to answer questions and understand the learning material.<sup>8</sup> In addition, women with children are perceived as less competent by prospective employers than those without and are subsequently offered reduced salaries, while the opposite can be true for men.<sup>9</sup></p><p>Also noteworthy, as antithesis to the goal of this exhibition, there are prevalent problems with women being heard and the challenges they face getting recognition. In colloquia, women are less likely to be invited speakers despite being equally as willing to accept invitations as men, and after academic seminars, women are less likely to ask questions.<sup>10</sup> Both of these effects respectively can be ameliorated if a woman is the colloquium chair or if another woman is the first to ask a question after a seminar. Perhaps most tellingly of all, men are less likely to give merit to research into these gender biases than women are, an effect that was repeated when the research that pointed this out was published.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Fortunately, there is persistent momentum in Western academia and politics to acknowledge and address gender bias as well as many other topics related to diversity and inclusion that have perpetuated inequalities. To address awareness of implicit bias, Harvard has opened its research (and <a href=\"https://osf.io/y9hiq/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">results</a>) on the subject to the public.</p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/24/6b66ac78-0545-7224-fb0f-87ef84766973/full/400,400/0/default.jpg\"></p><p><em>Fig 2.

You know best what makes your clock tick. Follow that intuition when you make decisions, start or end research projects and collaborations, set your career path, etc., but take advice from others because there is a wealth of experience and knowledge in the people around you that they are happy to share if you ask. Lastly, treat others as you want others to treat you.</p><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p>Speech-driven technology is used extensively. Think of the smart speaker in your living room, but also of all the possibilities that speech-driven technology offers in care and independence for the elderly and disabled. But... the current software only works effectively if the person speaking has reasonably standard pronunciation, so does not have a speech impediment, and speaks one of the approximately 2% of the world's languages for which speech-driven technology is available. Odette's aim is to build human speech-processing inspired speech technology for everyone, irrespective of the way and the language the person speaks.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/20BIEZyHr2o\" height=\"500\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><h3>Biography</h3><p><a href=\"https://odettescharenborg.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Odette Scharenborg</a> is an Associate Professor and Delft Technology Fellow at the Multimedia Computing Group (EEMCS) <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/stories/articles/improving-the-effectiveness-of-speech-recognition/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">working on human speech-processing inspired automatic speech processing</a> (PhD 2005, Radboud University).

For females, extra challenges appear. With persistence, confidence, and curiosity as power, you can overcome the barriers. The science community has your back: There are scholarships, awards and programs for women pursuing STEM. The roads are paved for you. If you have ever dreamed of being a scientist, don't let it go; instead fight for it. At the end of the journey, success will be waiting for you.</p><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Aviation is responsible for 5% of the total anthropogenic warming effects, including CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> effects (&gt;60%) from NOx, water vapor, contrails, and particulate matters. In the face of the continuing expansion of air traffic, mitigation of aviation's climate impact becomes challenging but imperative. Feijia Yin is committed to making aviation greener, hence reducing the climate impact of aviation. To this end, her research interests are in aircraft engine modeling, novel engine concepts, and climate assessment of aviation technologies and operational strategies. By working on this, she aims to identify the climate-neutral pathway for future aviation development. Her recent publication on the impact of hybrid-electric aircraft on contrail coverage has drawn intensive attention and is presented as a cover page story of the <em>Aerospace</em> journal.</p><h3>Biography</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Feijia Yin is an assistant professor at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TU Delft. She received her PhD degree in 2016 from TU Delft on modeling and characterizing a novel multi-fuel engine concept. Afterward, Feijia started her Postdoc research on assessing the climate impact of aviation and the effective mitigation strategies from operations and technologies. In 2019, she received the prestigious NWO VENI grant to evaluate the climate impact of future aircraft propulsion technologies. Her research on verification of NO<sub>x</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> algorithmic climate change functions received the best paper award in ICRAT 2018. She is a member of the IGTI Aero Engine Committee. She is currently involved in multiple EU projects on different sustainable aviation topics.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/feijia-yin-28265a27/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=o_VZzCoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Scholar</a></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Feijia_Yin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ResearchGate</a></p>",

The systems we inhabit as academics are flawed, based on a long history of bias and exclusion, and have been scientifically proven to hamper the progress of women, people of colour and differently abled people. Being aware of these factors, challenging them, and building strong support networks with allies is essential for any aspiring scientist. Be positive, be generous, be curious, and be courageous!</p><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p>In 2019 women represented 7.7% of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in the EU, and just 21% of top senior executives in America's biggest firms. This \"leaky pipeline\" stems from a range of social/organizational issues but the extent to which the physical, designed workplace influences these factors remains unexplored. Historically offices have been designed for men, often by men, yet little research exists on how workplace design affects workplace inequality. Through archival research and interviews, this architectural history project asks how have gender roles been articulated in office design since 1950 and to what extent has this affected workplace parity.</p><h3>Biography</h3><p>Amy Thomas is Assistant Professor of the History of Architecture and Urban Planning at TU Delft. Her research centres on the architecture of the commercial world: the places, people and processes via which capitalism, corporations and design intersect. Her forthcoming book with MIT Press explores the post-war development of London's financial centre, the City of London. In 2020 Thomas was awarded the <a href=\"https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/nwo-talent-programme/projects-veni/2020\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NWO Veni grant</a> for the project Her Office, investigating historical connections between gender, well-being and workplace design. She is an advocate for equality, diversity and inclusion, and works with the BauHow5 alliance to improve access to architectural education.</p>",

As a child, I was always curious about how things work and why humans behave the way we do. I wanted to know everything (and this tireless need for knowledge drove my parents crazy)! My determination to understand how to control machines brought me to the field of robotics, and my indefatigable need to understand human behavior drove me to the field of neuroscience. So, here is my advice: never lose curiosity. And do not listen to people who say that you will not be able to reach your goals!</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aiAMzfIEbdc\" height=\"500\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(37, 37, 37);\">Every year, millions of stroke survivors lose their functional autonomy due to paralysis, posing a tremendous societal and economic challenge. In absence of a cure for stroke, neuroscience evidence suggests that patients should engage in personalized, high-intensity training to maximize their recovery. I worked directly with stroke survivors and witnessed the potential for improvement that robotic devices and virtual reality can bring to their lives. Robots can deliver high-intensity training in an engaging virtual environment at a low cost. The goal of my research is to maximize patients' recovery by employing versatile robotic devices that provide personalized physical assistance in realistic and engaging virtual environments.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Biography</h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(37, 37, 37);\">Laura Marchal-Crespo&nbsp;is an Associate Professor at the Department of Cognitive Robotics, Faculty 3mE, TU Delft since September 2020.

It is very easy to question ourselves when there is a conflicting opinion from a senior colleague. But we need to keep in mind that the senior colleague is more experienced in some topics but not necessarily in our research topics. In most cases of Ph.D. research, we are the ones with the deepest understanding. Be open and outspoken of your opinion. Then bring more solid evidence and calculation to the table.</p><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p>Wen-Jun Cao's research develops the fundamental understanding of circularity in the design, construction, operation, maintenance and repair cycle of civil infrastructure. Nowadays, the Engineering and Construction industry is the world's largest raw materials consumer, responsible for 36 % of final energy use and 39% of energy and process-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2018. I see circular infrastructure as one potential solution to reduce the environmental impacts. According to my calculations (assuming the average cost saving through circular strategies is 5% - 15%), with every 1% of the road sector adopting the recommended strategy, the potential market we are dealing with is worth $15- 53 billion from 2016 to 2040.&nbsp;</p><h3>Biography</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/engineering-structures/sections-labs/resources-recycling/staff/dr-w-wen-jun-cao/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wen-Jun Cao</a> is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Engineering<span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"> </span>Structures, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences.

At the same time, the academic environment can be experienced as competitive and people may feel that they need to excel in everything. My advice to junior researchers, female and male alike, is that they should not compare themselves too much with their peers, but rely on their own strengths. All the competition and comparison can be paralyzing and is not constructive. Find your strength and dare to make choices.</p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/24/c9f1b884-b134-9e38-65d1-9b518a1ca6f1/full/full/0/default.jpg\"></p><p><em>Fig 1. Flooding example, Credit: Doorn</em></p><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p>My research focuses on ethical issues in water governance and climate change. It is nowadays increasingly recognized that, partly due to climate change, our water system is under severe pressure and water authorities are looking for ways to address these challenges. I am regularly invited to provide advice on water policy or strategy of water organizations. But working at a university, my impact on society is not limited to research and the valorization thereof. Educating a new generation of responsible engineers also has a major impact on society. I am proud to contribute to that as well.</p><h3>Biography</h3><p><a href=\"https://ethicsandtechnology.eu/member/neelke_doorn/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neelke Doorn</a> is professor of \"Ethics of water engineering\" and Director of Education for the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management.

The versatile applications of shape morphing objects, Credit: Ghodrat</em></p><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p>My research is situated on the bridge connecting materials science to design. My main research topic focuses on investigating the properties of shape memory materials (alloys, polymers and composites) and applying them as active elements in designing shape morphing objects. This gives free rein to designers' creativity to make interactive objects which have a dynamic relation with users. A number of good practices designed under my supervision include deployable structures, self-sizable adaptable shoes, self-sizable grips, self-regulating jackets and soft mobile devices.

Their underrepresentation in leading scientific positions is rather a matter of life priorities as a result of nature's calling to have a healthy family. Excellence and dedication are the only qualities that are the key to a scientific career today.

The desire to cure or to improve the quality of life of patients is driving the development of advanced diagnostics and curative/palliative therapies. Therefore, convergence of chemistry, nanotechnology and medicine that leads to interdisciplinary solutions by bringing together chemists, biologists, physicists, engineers and physicians is the key strategy. Collaboration with Erasmus MC brings us very close to the problem-driven research and hence to the patients as end users.&nbsp;</p><h3>Biography</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Kristina Djanashvili is Associate Professor at the Department of Biotechnology. Operating at the Reactor Institute Delft, she exploits her expertise in organic-, radio- and nanochemistry as well as physico-chemical methods to design synergic systems for better detection, visualization and treatment of cancer. After introducing this approach in her doctoral research, distinguished with a DEWIS Award for the best female PhD candidate 2009, she has received a prestigious NWO-VENI grant (2013) on nanoparticles for MRI and radiotherapy. Together with her dynamic multidisciplinary research group, she is looking for innovative ways that chemistry can offer to solve medical problems.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://nl.linkedin.com/in/kristina-djanashvili-87a796b4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p>",

Sometimes, and hopefully not too often, you need to compromise and attune to a culture you may not like or are not familiar with. Then seek for opportunities to benefit from it. Make your own ideals visible and connect to colleagues that share similar values so you can help each other out. Sooner or later your added value will be recognized. And if not, you can always become a Don(na) Quixote!</p><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p>In my work I have always been seeking for contributions to societal issues through design. From 1992 to 1995, I was engaged in international design projects in developing areas. One of the results was the publication of a Tricycle Production Manual, which has been distributed worldwide. In 2015, I defended my doctoral thesis <a href=\"https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Afc87dfd1-b7eb-4c84-b6c7-6835c5e837f8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Crossing Cultural Chasms - towards a culture-conscious approach to design</em></a>, and 4 years later my PhD student Chen Hao defended <a href=\"https://books.ipskampprinting.nl/thesis/534345-hao/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cultura: Achieving intercultural empathy through contextual user research in design</em></a>. My research focuses on the role of culture in design processes, supporting designers with a culture sensitive approach to design. The higher aim is to contribute to diversity in all its facets. Actual topics addressed are gender and skin colour biases in design.</p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/24/3c9789e4-98e4-d3ce-6096-6dab12df3f7f/full/full/0/default.jpg\"></p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/24/e0b9ae69-729b-2c33-6d80-426419199236/full/full/0/default.jpg\"></p><h3>Biography</h3><p><a href=\"https://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/studiolab/vanboeijen/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Annemiek van Boeijen</a> finished design studies in 1990 with the design of a carbon-fibre racing wheelchair for Veldink BV, presented at the Paralympics 1990 in Assen (NL), and since then displayed in exhibitions, most recently in <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/io/50/exhibition/1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Designed for our Future</em></a> in Delft.

This led to many (scientific) adventures, but maybe it would be wise to select a bit better than I do/did to protect your agenda a bit.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaqLGhiSSyU?start=18\" height=\"500\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><h3>Research's Impact on Society</h3><p>My early research led to the wastewater treatment technology Nereda<sup>®</sup>, that uses less energy and has a much lower footprint than conventional treatment plants. This technology is applied in over 100 installations worldwide. Developing and improving treatment technologies, leads to cleaner surface water and to chances for enhanced recovery of resources that are important for society, such as fertilizers and biogas. This is underlined in the programme <a href=\"https://lotushr.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LOTUS_HR</a> that I lead, in which we develop small scale water treatment technologies for local and safe water reuse in (mega) cities in India.</p><h3>Biography</h3><p>I am appointed as professor of Environmental Technology. I spent my career moving from industry to TU Delft to a Dutch Water authority and back to TU Delft again. I study and teach domestic wastewater treatment and resource recovery, with a focus on sludge digestion and granular sludge systems, closely collaborating with water authorities and industry. I received a <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/research/stories-of-science/sustainable-waste-water-purification/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VIDI grant for my research about the removal of complex contaminants with granular sludge</a>. I am also active in education: teaching and development of on-line and blended education. I initiated and coordinate the MSc track/programme Environmental Engineering, and I was appointed as an education fellow.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/merle-de-kreuk-79520a1/?originalSubdomain=nl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p>",

Beeping medical alarms, staff and visitor conversations, droning medical devices and caregiving activities that clatter, buzz and ping naturally contribute to high noise levels turning hospitals into an acoustically hostile environment in which neither can patients recover comfortably nor can medical staff operate safely and efficiently.&nbsp;Elif Ozcan, with her sound-driven design approach, questions the positive and negative role of sounds in healthcare and demonstrates how designers can turn the sound problem into opportunities with human-sensitive and evidence-based technological solutions that cater for better recovery and better clinical flow.</p><h3>Biography</h3><p>Elif Ozcan is a scholar in the field of sound-driven design and advocate for medical innovation that focuses on personal needs and values such as pleasure, dignity, sense of achievement and mental health. She has worked with Toyota Motors Europe and the European Space Agency on the topic of designing human-centered alarms for complex systems. As a result, in 2017, Dr. Ozcan partnered with Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam and established the <a href=\"https://delftdesignlabs.org/criticalalarmslab/media-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Critical Alarms Lab</a> in 2017 to study the concept of a Silent ICU.
