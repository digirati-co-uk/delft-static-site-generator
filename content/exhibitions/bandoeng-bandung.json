Their early designs in the East Indies were heavily influenced by the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright and showed little consideration for the Indonesian context.",

His Bandung designs vary from the Art Deco Villa Isola to the protestant Bethelkerk and the Cipaganti mosque.",

The circular complex, which included a vast garden, took inspiration from both modern Art Deco and ancient Hindu temple architecture. The building now serves as the headmastership office of the Indonesia University of Education."

                    "Henri Maclaine Pont (1884 – 1971) was born on Java in the Dutch East Indies and studied architecture in Delft from 1902-09. After his studies he returned to the East Indies and worked as a designer for the Semarang-Cheribon steam tram company in Semarang. Maclaine Pont was fascinated by indigenous building techniques and trained local craftsmen to work on his buildings.",
                    "In 1918, Maclaine Pont was asked to design the campus for the newly founded technical college in Bandung, the first institute of higher technical learning in the Dutch colony. His preliminary plans were inspired by Javanese palace complexes (kratons) in Solo and Yogjakarta. For the first two buildings, he took inspiration from the traditional Sumatran Minangkabau roof system. The buildings are still in use today by ITB."
