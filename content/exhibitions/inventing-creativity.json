We might assume it’s just a new word for old concepts like imagination, inspiration, fantasy, genius, or originality. But creativity seems to capture a unique spectrum of meanings: It can denote both an ability and a process,&nbsp;great works of genius as well as everyday innovations; something both deeply personal and also socially and economically valuable; and, though it seems essentially connected to the arts, it is apparently also applicable to science, technology, and any other endeavor. How can this sometimes contradictory array of meanings and connotations help explain creativity’s sudden appeal in postwar America, and today?</p><p>It was not bohemian artists or hippies who first theorized creativity, but rather engineers, psychologists, and advertising men, people deeply intertwined with post-World War II military and consumer industries. As they attempted to balance individual liberation with the productivity and predictability demanded by the system, these people devised new psychological tests to identify “creative” employees, methods for stimulating “creative thinking,” and diagrams of “the creative process.” Was this a heroic campaign to liberate humanity from the stifling forces of bureaucratic conformity? Or a cynical attempt to tame messy and revolutionary human energies? How has this history influenced our own feelings about creativity?</p><p><img src=\"https://dlc.services/thumbs/7/21/30dd851d-ba9f-44da-aee0-2fc8353003bf/full/full/0/default.jpg\"></p><p><em>Frequency of the term “creative” in books in English, 1800-2020.

                  "<blockquote>“In a time when knowledge, constructive and destructive, is advancing by the most incredible leaps and bounds into a fantastic atomic age, genuinely creative adaptation seems to represent the only possibility that man can keep abreast of the kaleidoscopic change in his world … international annihilation will be the price we pay for a lack of creativity.” –&nbsp;Carl Rogers, humanistic psychologist, Toward a Theory of Creativity, 1954</blockquote><blockquote>“The Cold War called for ever-accelerating efforts in a contest of intellects. Inventive brains were at a premium, and there were never enough.” – J. P. Guilford, psychologist, Journal of Creative Behavior, 1967 The 1950s and 1960s contained the perfect storm for an idea like creativity to arise: During the Cold War “the West,” led by a newly empowered United States, was competing with the Soviet Union in a race of military technology.</blockquote><p>Postwar America contained the perfect conditions for the concept of creativity to arise–a potent mix of optimism about material progress and fears of conformity and technology run amok.</p><p>As the United States competed with the Soviet Union in a race of military technology, its economy depended on a constant stream of consumer goods. Many saw totalitarianism abroad and consumerism at home as twin threats to individualism. With the recent experience of the Holocaust and the looming threat of nuclear Armageddon in mind, some critics worried about the effect of mass society and “conformity” on humane values. Corporate America, for its part, feared its own bureaucratic culture might slow the innovation on which profits depended.</p><p>CREATIVITY was a salve for all these problems: it conjured individuality, self-expression, and freedom, but also promised all the inventiveness and dynamism necessary to keep the whole system running.</p>"

          "Postwar managers of corporations like General Electric, Alcoa, and General Motors dreamed of making innovation as predictable as cars off an assembly line. But they also worried that too much bureaucracy might stifle good ideas. How to summon the genius of the nineteenth-century inventor within the modern corporation? Increasingly they looked to experts offering new-fangled techniques for \"creative thinking\" and \"creative problem-solving\".",

          "These early creativity consultants claimed white collar workers were too rational and needed help accessing their irrational and poetic sides. In highly-structured, replicable sessions, buttoned-up types were encouraged to get wild and break rules – temporarily, at least – to generate profitable new ideas. These experts claimed their methods could be used to solve any problem from domestic arguments to ending the nuclear standoff, but they were most widely taken up in the world from which they emerged: corporate R&D and product development."

We need a direct analogy first.</blockquote><blockquote>Alex:</blockquote><blockquote>How about pregnancy? Swelling abdomen – rounding?</blockquote><blockquote>Bill:</blockquote><blockquote>When I think of rounding,&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>I think about the universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Horace:</blockquote><blockquote>Marble.</blockquote><blockquote>Jack:</blockquote><blockquote>Let’s take a symbolic analogy of marble.</blockquote><blockquote>Jim:</blockquote><blockquote>Well, let’s see, I’m a very still lake – and I get tremendous enjoyment from reflecting all the objects that come over me – and I’m terribly upset when the wind blows and the ripples form so that the reflections can’t be transmitted.</blockquote><blockquote>Horace:</blockquote><blockquote>Ripples destroy the reflections.</blockquote><blockquote>Jim:</blockquote><blockquote>Yeah, ripples ruin me.</blockquote><blockquote>Bill:</blockquote><blockquote>On that same lake, let me get in there. I have enjoyment from the knowledge … that the waters from me gave birth to little streams but I’m especially proud when I realize that some of the waters which come from me leave me in evaporation … I see this beautiful colored rainbow. I realize this is a child of mine …</blockquote><p>Printed in Tom Alexander, “Synectics: Inventing by the Madness Method,” Fortune, August 1965</p>"

The ultimate aim of many researchers was to devise a new test able to identify inventive people early in life, a particular wish of the massive government and private R&D apparatus that proliferated after WWII. In service of this aim, researchers collected large data sets and employed the most sophisticated statistical methods, even though many of the assessments could be extremely hard to quantify."

Much of this research was initially funded by the U.S. military, looking for ways to identify, train, and retain talented scientists and engineers. But it was also attractive to those who hoped for social and cultural progress as well. By the late 1960s research had been carried out on cadets, famous writers, primary school children, and a host of others, in the hopes of unlocking the secrets of human ingenuity.",

          "But before they could approach the topic researchers had to first define it: how would they know creativity when they saw it? Some researchers would only consider eminent figures with a proven record, while others insisted they could study creativity in children. Though researchers never reached a consensus on the ultimate criteria of creativity, they were united in the belief that creativity research was a dire social need. The figure of the “creative person” that emerged from their research was an ideal liberal citizen capable of resisting conformity, adapting to change, and being innovative all at the same time."

In creativity literature the idealized figure of the romantic artist is a model for us to emulate, not for his or her ability to make art – reading books on creativity will not make us skilled painters – but rather for other attributes seen as desirable, such as flexibility, passion, playfulness, rebelliousness, and above all a purported penchant for novelty. Yet even as creativity experts embrace the figure of the artist, they are also quick to disown the reputation of the wild-eyed bohemian who is hostile to capitalism. Truly creative people, they say, can thrive even in the commercial or technical worlds. Creativity is like the essence of the artist, distilled and bottled for general use."
