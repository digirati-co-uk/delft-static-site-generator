## Trésor

The Trésor includes historic books, journals, maps, photographs and prints from before 1900. Their age, rarity, value or vulnerability is what makes them special. The Trésor also collects TU Delft output that is not usually included in academic journals, like speeches, dissertations and lecture notes. Visit the [Trésor website](https://tresor.tudelft.nl) for more information.
